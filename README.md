The best way to following this github is as follows :

## a. Selection criteria and cuts 
This can be seen in notebook `CUTS_SELECTION_CRITERIA`.

## b. Recovery rate 
This can be seen in notebook `RECOVERY_RATES_DETECTORS (2)` and `RECOVERY_RATE_ICPC_DETECTORS (2)`.

## c. Magnitude
This can be seen in notebook `MAGNITUDE_DETECTORS (2)` and `MAGNITUDE_ICPC (2)`.

## d. Coincident events 
This can be seen in notebook `COINCIDENT_EVENTS`.

The data analysis of the results from these notebooks can be seen : 
- `Histogram_plots_frequency`
- `Histogram_plots_recovery_rates`
- `Histogram_plots_magnitude`
- `Histogram_plots_coincident_events`

If you want to replicate the method for multiple runs the notebook `REPEAT_NOTEBOOKS` can be used. 
This notebook makes a copy of a,b,c and d but with a changed data from another run.
